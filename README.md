# html2Rmd

Convert html generated by R Markdown back to Rmd

Usage:

./html2rmd.sh [--no-header] input.html [output.Rmd]

If the output file is omitted, it's input.Rmd.

Options:

--no-header

By default, the tool inserts a header and a reference part to the generated Rmd. Use the option to skip them.
